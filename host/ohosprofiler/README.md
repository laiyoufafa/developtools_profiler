## USE

1.To prepare development tools, you can use IntelliJ idea Community Edition or IntelliJ idea Ultimate Edition

2.Using the development tool to import a project, if you are using it for the first time, you need to load ideaic. 
In fact, this file is IntelliJ idea community version, when debugging plug-ins, idea will synchronously start a 
community version of idea with plug-ins installed, which is relatively large and time-consuming

3.Local packaging: after entering the main interface, select gradle in the right column and click build plug under IntelliJ.
If the execution is successful, the build file will be created in the root directory of the project by default, 
and the packaged plug-ins will be in the directory of build / distributions.The plug-in without dependency is jar package, 
and the plug-in with dependency is ZIP format. Either one can be installed directly in idea plug.
Open file ➡ Settings ➡ Plugins, select the gear button, and select Install plug from disk
